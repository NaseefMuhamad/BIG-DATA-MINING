this was an assignemnt given to us testing our knowledge on usig r and descriptive statistices
the first question needed us to find the time series trend disbyrdment amounts given to uganda
Disbursements were minimal before the 1990s, suggesting limited financial engagement. from the graph we can see that
# - A sharp increase occurred in the early 1990s, likely due to major development programs.
# - The peak in 1995 indicates a high concentration of funding, possibly for infrastructure or recovery.
# - After 1995, disbursements declined and fluctuated, reflecting changing priorities or project cycles.
the second question required us to find the overalll credit status of loans they were three where fully paid, terminated and cancelled, from these we can see that uganda is indeed reliable as 51 of the loans were fully repaid and 1 was cancelled during the planning phase

the third question required us to find the distribution of the principal loan amounts given to uganda, i decided to plot my grapg as frequency against the initial amounts as if i used years it would be atime series trend but frqueency gave me a better idea of how much funds we were getting, it showed that iniatially the country got really modest amounts and some rare occurances the country was given really large amounts
